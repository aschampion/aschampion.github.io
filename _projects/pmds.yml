description: |
  In Spring 2012 I implemented a 2D parallel molecular dynamics simulation for Georgia Tech's CSE 6730 Modeling & Simulation. Along with a team listed on the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/aschampion/gt-cse6730-pmds), the simulating contains a serial version and two distributed memory decompositions in Fortran 90 and OpenMPI. My contributions to the project also include a rudimentary visualizer in Processing and dataset generator in C99.

  We simulated micelle formation by simple hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules based on the [LAMMPS micelle](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_example.html) example simulation.

  To try it yourself with `gfortran`:

  {% highlight console %}
  git clone git@github.com:aschampion/gt-cse6730-pmds.git
  cd gt-cse6730-pmds
  make all
  ./pmds # Note that this will take some time and produce a ~200MB dump file
  {% endhighlight %}
