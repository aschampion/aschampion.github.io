I'm investigating statistical properties of metal artifact reduction in computed tomography x-rays of spinal implants as a scientific programming consultant for Douglas Robertson, M.D. (Emory/Georgia Tech). Details of the project will be available once closer to publication, but my work involves:

* Computer vision and 3D volume segmentation
* Implementation of morphological operators on the GPU (CUDA) with MATLAB bindings
* Machine learning for model parameterization
