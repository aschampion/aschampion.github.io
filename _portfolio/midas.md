Since first wearing an Oculus in a visualization lab at Georgia Tech I've been fascinated with the new visualization and interaction affordances VR can create for data and model exploration. While a public prototype isn't ready to be revealed, the project involves:

* Arduino (C++ & Processing for hardware monitoring)
* Sensor fusion, including IMU, computer vision (OpenCV), and custom sensors
* Closed-loop actuator control adaptive to individual users and interactions
* Rapid hardware iteration with 3D filament printing
