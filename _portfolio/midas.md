Since first wearing the Oculus Rift in a lab at Georgia Tech I've been fascinated with the novel visualizations and interactions VR affords for data and model exploration. I'm prototyping a device exploring if what makes the rift successful as a display &mdash; latency below a sensory-feedback critical barrier made affordable by commodity hardware &mdash; can be also be achieved for intuitive haptic interaction. While a public prototype isn't ready to be revealed, the project involves:

* Arduino (C++ & Processing for hardware monitoring)
* Sensor fusion, including inertial, computer vision (OpenCV), and custom sensors
* Closed-loop actuator control adaptive to individual users and interactions
* Rapid hardware iteration with 3D filament printing
